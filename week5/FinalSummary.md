### Global Economic Overview:
1. **Economic Slowdown**:
   - **US**: Significant slowdown in economic activities, reflected by near 3-year lows in Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) and a rising unemployment rate (4.3% in July 2024 from 4.1% in June 2024). PMIs eased, and the housing sector continues to be under pressure.
   - **China**: Manufacturing PMI dipped into contraction territory. Slower growth in manufacturing and infrastructure investments, continued weakness in the real estate sector, and decreased industrial production.
   - **Eurozone**: Economic activity remains sluggish.

2. **Inflation Trends**:
   - **US**: Inflation inched lower with a broad-based easing in goods, housing, and services.
   - **China**: Inflation remained subdued.

### Monetary Policy:
- **US Federal Reserve (FOMC)**: Maintained the policy unchanged in July 2024 but with a dovish outlook. Post-July NFP data, rate cut expectations have surged, with markets anticipating a 125 bps rate cut by December 31, 2024.
- **Other Central Banks**:
   - **UK and China**: Entering rate-cut modes as of July 2024.

### Indian Economy:
- **Economic Activity**:
   - Demonstrated resilience amid global slowdown.
   - Improvements seen across several metrics including PMIs, retail auto sales, GST collections, power demand, digital spending, and employment.
   - Tractor sales continue to contract YoY.

- **Economic Growth and Outlook**:
   - Anticipated steady growth in FY25, supported by robust industrial and investment activities alongside a resilient services sector and urban consumption.
   - Optimistic outlook on rural recovery due to favorable monsoon progress.

### Trade Deficit:
- **Trade Deficit**: Declined from USD 23.8 billion in May 2024 to USD 21.0 billion in June 2024, primarily due to a sharp fall in oil imports.
- **Specifics**:
   - **Net Oil Imports**: Fell by 27.7%.
   - **Net Gold Imports**: Increased by 8.4%.
   - **NONG^ Net Imports**: Grew by 7.7%.

### Detailed Economic Indicators for India:
- Diverse trends observed across economic indicators like 2W sales, PV sales, GST Collection, Power Demand, Unemployment, PMI, etc.

### Observations of Indian Economic Indicators:
1. **Retail Auto Sales**:
   - Fluctuations in YoY growth rates observed.
   - Strong growth in 2W and PV in specific months (e.g., 33.6% YoY growth in 2W in April 2024).

2. **PMI**:
   - Manufacturing and Services PMI showed consistent strength in the expansionary zone.

3. **Unemployment**:
   - Hovering around 7-9%, peaking at 9.2% in June 2024.

### Conclusion:
The US and China's economies are experiencing a slowdown, with the US facing rising unemployment and decreasing PMI readings, while China's manufacturing and infrastructure investments are waning. The US market is gearing up for potential rate cuts, while other major economies like the UK and China have already begun easing interest rates.

Meanwhile, India appears to be somewhat insulated from these global headwinds, with key economic indicators showing resilience, though challenges remain in certain sectors like tractors. The trade deficit has improved driven largely by decreased oil imports.

This data highlights the divergence in economic momentum and policy responses across major economies, with India showing relatively better growth prospects in the near term.
